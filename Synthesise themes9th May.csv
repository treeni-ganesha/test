Empowering impact of collective efficacy ,,,,"Empowerment can be seen as a key outcome of the collective belief system. When teachers and staff have a strong sense of collective efficacy, it empowers them to take ownership of their roles and responsibilities, make decisions, and contribute to positive changes in student outcomes. This empowerment fosters a collaborative and supportive environment where individuals feel valued and capable of making a difference. Ultimately, empowerment leads to enhanced motivation, engagement, and overall success in education.

Empowering and feedback develop collective efficacy,,,,"To develop collective efficacy, it's important to empower group members and give them feedback on their performance. Setting small, achievable goals and having a strong leader who brings everyone together for a shared purpose are also crucial. These factors help build the belief that the group can succeed, leading to better outcomes. To develop collective efficacy, empower the group, give feedback, set achievable goals, and have a strong leader. This builds confidence in the group's ability to succeed.",,,"Empowerment among group members is positively associated with collective efficacy. Empowered followers are more likely to initiate tasks they find interesting and important, believe in their own skills and resources, and have positive work experiences. This empowerment is an important condition for both self-efficacy and collective efficacy.","Empowering teachers to have influence over instructional decisions in their schools increases their confidence in the collective capability of the faculty to educate students.When teachers are given the opportunity to participate in making important decisions about instruction in their schools, it enhances their belief in the overall capability of the faculty to educate students. This means that when teachers have a say in shaping the educational process, they feel more confident in their collective ability to make a positive impact on students' learning. Empowering teachers in decision-making can strengthen their belief in the effectiveness of their team and contribute to a positive organizational culture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It suggests that leaders' behaviors and attitudes can influence the development and maintenance of collective efficacy within the team.,,"These findings highlight the importance of transformational leadership in promoting empowerment, group cohesiveness, and perceived group effectiveness. They also emphasize the significance of empowerment for collective efficacy and suggest that actual positive experiences in group work may be crucial for the development of collective efficacy.",,,,,,"In other words, transformational leadership influences collective efficacy through the establishment of cognitive trust within the team.",,,,"Moral leadership, which involves ethical behavior, has a positive impact on collective efficacy. This means that when leaders demonstrate ethical conduct, it influences employees' beliefs about their collective capabilities and encourages ethical behavior within the group.When leaders act in a selfless and trustworthy manner, it creates a high level of collective belief in employees' joint ability. This highlights the importance of ethical behavior in shaping collective efficacy.

",,,,,,"From a collective efficacy perspective, this finding suggests that individuals' perceptions of their own group's abilities are influenced by comparing themselves to other groups. Higher-performing groups tend to underestimate their abilities, possibly due to a higher standard of comparison, while lower-performing groups may overestimate their abilities, possibly as a form of self-enhancement. This indicates that collective efficacy beliefs can be shaped by social comparisons and may not always accurately reflect the actual capabilities of the group.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Collective efficacy and self-efficacy were related,,,,,,"It means that initially, there is a strong relationship between individuals' belief in their own abilities (self-efficacy) and their belief in the group's abilities (collective efficacy). However, as they work together and gain more experience, individuals start to rely less on their own self-efficacy and more on their trust in the group's collective capabilities. This shift indicates that individuals recognize the value and strength of working as a team, leading to a decrease in the importance of individual self-efficacy in determining collective efficacy.",,"
A strong sense of collective efficacy enhances teachers' self-efficacy beliefs, while weak collective efficacy beliefs undermine teachers' sense of efficacy, and vice versa.This statement suggests that there is a reciprocal relationship between collective efficacy beliefs and teachers' individual self-efficacy beliefs. When teachers have a strong sense of collective efficacy, meaning they believe in the collective capability of their team or organization to achieve goals, it has a positive impact on their own self-efficacy beliefs. They feel more confident in their own abilities to perform well and make a difference in their work. This is because they perceive that their collective efforts and collaboration with others contribute to overall effectiveness. On the other hand, if collective efficacy beliefs are weak, it can undermine teachers' sense of efficacy. When teachers doubt the collective capability of their team or organization, it can negatively affect their own beliefs about their effectiveness as individual educators. They may feel less confident in their abilities and may question the impact of their work. In summary, the strength of collective efficacy beliefs influences teachers' individual self-efficacy beliefs. A strong collective efficacy enhances teachers' confidence and belief in their own capabilities, while weak collective efficacy beliefs can diminish their sense of efficacy. When teachers believe that their team or organization is capable of achieving goals together (collective efficacy), it boosts their confidence in their own abilities (self-efficacy). But if they doubt the team's capability, it can undermine their confidence in themselves. So, collective efficacy affects how teachers see themselves and their effectiveness.

However, if collective efficacy beliefs are weak, it can have negative effects. It may lead to low morale, decreased motivation, and limited collaboration, hindering the organization's ability to achieve its goals and create a supportive learning environment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Backing up behaviour,,,,,,,,,,,"teams with higher collective efficacy were more likely to engage in behaviors that involved providing and accepting help and assistance from team members.This is because team members with high collective efficacy are confident that they can provide and accept help without compromising overall team performance.Backing up behavior is important because it helps team members support and assist each other. When team members back each other up, they collaborate, share resources, and adapt to challenges more effectively. It promotes teamwork, knowledge sharing, and improves overall team performance.higher collective efficacy beliefs were associated with increased backing up behavior within teams.

collective efficacy and self-efficacy are distinct,,,,,,,,,,,"The study highlighted the distinct nature of collective efficacy and self-efficacy. While both constructs can have similar effects on individual and team performance, collective efficacy appeared to exert its influence primarily through social-behavioral processes, while self-efficacy primarily influenced cognitive-behavioral processes.Yes, the study suggests that collective efficacy and self-efficacy are distinct constructs. While both collective efficacy and self-efficacy can have positive effects on individual and team performance, they operate through different cognitive-behavioral processes. Self-efficacy primarily influences performance through individual cognitive processes, while collective efficacy exerts its influence primarily through social-behavioral processes within a team context. The study highlights the importance of recognizing the unique nature of collective efficacy and self-efficacy in understanding their impact on teamwork and performance.

"collective efficacy evolves over time.




",,,,,,,,,,,"Collective efficacy beliefs in a team were generally stable over time, but what influenced those beliefs and how much team members agreed on them could change. This shows that collective efficacy is not fixed and can evolve as the team goes through different experiences and interactions. It's like a living thing that adapts and grows with the team. The study found that collective efficacy judgments, which are beliefs about the group's ability to succeed, tended to remain relatively consistent over time. However, the extent to which team members shared these judgments and the factors that influenced their judgments were found to change over time. This suggests that while collective efficacy itself may exhibit stability, the specific dynamics and influences that shape it can vary as teams progress and evolve. This highlights the dynamic nature of collective efficacy within a team, as it is influenced by ongoing interactions, experiences, and perceptions among team members.This implies that while the overall level of collective efficacy may remain consistent, the factors shaping and influencing those beliefs may evolve over time.",,,,,,,,,,,

CCSE is found to be a significant predictor of the team's creative outcome and is associated with the perception of overall team creative output.

The study suggests that high CCSE contributes to a positive team creativity climate, characterized by team unity, support for innovation, and a shared vision. This positive climate, in turn, facilitates the team's perception of their creative output and their ability to bring novelty to products and services.

","The concept of perceived collective efficacy is important when studying the management of Open Innovation (OI) projects. It helps us understand how employees' beliefs about their collective ability affect their innovative behavior. When employees believe they can work together effectively, it influences their willingness to explore new knowledge and be creative in their work. In other words, collective efficacy plays a role in promoting collaboration and innovation within an organization.These findings highlight the importance of collective efficacy in driving innovative behavior within OI projects. A shared belief in the group's ability to innovate positively influences employees' willingness to take risks, generate novel ideas, and collaborate effectively to achieve project goals. It emphasizes the role of group-level confidence in fostering a supportive and empowering environment for innovation.","Collective teacher efficacy has a significant positive impact on teaching innovation, indicating that when teachers collectively believe in their abilities to overcome challenges and achieve goals, they are more likely to engage in innovative teaching practices"

",,,,,,,,,,,,,"The study showed that trust in the team leader and trust among team members contribute to the development of collective efficacy.the formation of collective efficacy within a team is influenced by two types of cognitive trust: cognitive trust in the team leader and cognitive trust among team members. Cognitive trust refers to the belief and confidence team members have in the competence, reliability, and abilities of others, either their team leader or their fellow team members. The study found that both forms of cognitive trust play a significant role in shaping the collective efficacy of the team. Cognitive trust in the team leader refers to team members' trust and confidence in the competence and leadership abilities of their leader. When team members trust their leader's capabilities, they are more likely to develop a sense of collective efficacy, believing that as a team, they can accomplish tasks successfully.",,,,,,,,,
high collective efficacy impact  information exchange on innovation performance is reduced.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When collective efficacy is high in Chinese NPD (New Product Development) teams, the impact of information exchange on innovation performance is reduced. In other words, the positive relationship between sharing information within the team and achieving innovative outcomes is not as strong when the team members already have a high level of collective efficacy.This could be due to the fact that when team members have a strong belief in their collective efficacy, they may rely more on their existing knowledge and skills rather than actively seeking and exchanging new information. They may feel confident in their abilities to innovate and may prioritize internal resources and expertise over external information. As a result, the influence of information exchange on innovation performance diminishes in teams with high collective efficacy.

Collective efficacy moderates as well,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Collective efficacy moderates the relationship between behavioral integration and innovation performance.
This means that when a team works together well and coordinates their actions effectively (behavioral integration), their ability to innovate and come up with new ideas is influenced by their collective belief in their own capabilities (collective efficacy). If the team has high collective efficacy, it strengthens the positive relationship between their teamwork and innovation performance. In simpler terms, when a team believes in themselves and works together smoothly, they are more likely to be innovative and successful.",,,,,,,
"Efficacy and performance: Curved relationship.




",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"The study found that when a team believes in themselves and their abilities (team efficacy), their performance improves. However, if the team's belief becomes too strong, their performance starts to decline. So, there is an optimal level of team efficacy that leads to the best performance.team efficacy is generally beneficial for team performance, there is an optimal level to strive for, and the influence of team efficacy on performance is influenced by the level of team cohesion. Understanding these relationships can help organizations and teams optimize their performance by balancing and leveraging team efficacy and cohesion.The findings indicate that up to a certain level, team efficacy positively contributes to team performance. When team members have a high level of belief in their collective ability, they are motivated to exert effort and collaborate effectively, leading to improved team performance.

However, the relationship between team efficacy and team performance becomes negative when team efficacy becomes too high. This suggests that excessively high levels of team efficacy may lead to complacency, groupthink, or other negative dynamics that hinder performance.

Cohesion and efficacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Excessive team cohesion can hinder the positive impact of moral leadership on collective efficacy, while higher levels of collective efficacy, combined with team cohesion, enhance organizational commitment.",,,,,
"Diversity boosts team performance with collective efficacy.




",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"When a team believes in its ability to succeed together (collective efficacy), it can benefit from diversity. The study shows that when teams learn together by reflecting, discussing different ideas, and making thoughtful decisions, their confidence in their collective abilities grows. This confidence helps the team perform better, especially when they embrace diversity.The study suggests that when teams embrace diversity, meaning they value and include different perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds, it can lead to positive outcomes. One reason for this is that diversity fosters team learning. When team members engage in activities like reflecting on their work, discussing different ideas and viewpoints, and making informed decisions, they learn from each other and expand their knowledge. As the team learns together and embraces diversity, they also build confidence in their collective abilities. This collective efficacy, or belief in their shared capability, positively impacts team performance. When team members trust in their abilities and work together effectively, they are more likely to achieve their goals and perform well as a team. So, in summary, when teams embrace diversity and engage in learning activities, it enhances their collective efficacy, which in turn leads to improved team performance.
